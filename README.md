# Angular First Try Project

This is a simple project I made while learning the Angular Framework. It has all the possible crude and uses a json server as a database to store added data and fetch them ffor the project. This project was made for the sole purpose of learning the framework.

## Development server

Use `npm install` to instal dependencies if it is your first time running the project.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
